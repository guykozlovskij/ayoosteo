        Western medical acupuncture or dry needling is a beneficial adjunct to osteopathic treatment in the management
        and rehabilitation of patients with pain, inflammation, muscular spasm and tension. It is used in many NHS
        general practice, private clinics and pain clinics in the UK as a complement to conventional medicine.
      </p>
      <strong>
        <p>How does it work?</p>
      </strong>
      <p>
        “Acupuncture stimulates the nerves in skin and muscle, and can produce a variety of effects. We know that it
        increases the body’s release of natural painkillers – endorphin and serotonin – in the pain pathways of both the
        spinal cord and the brain. This modifies the way pain signals are received.” (The British Medical Acupuncture
        Society)
      </p>
      <strong>
        <p>
          How can Western Medical Acupuncture help you?
        </p>
      </strong>
      <p>
        Currently the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends acupuncture for chronic tension
        type headaches and migraines. It is also used to treat neck pain, back pain, muscular or ligamentous strain,
        arthritis, joint pain, tendonitis, and chronic pain.
      </p>
      <strong>
        <p>Is it safe?</p>
      </strong>
      <p>Western medical acupuncture is regarded as being completely safe when practiced by a qualified health
        practitioner who has had extra training in acupuncture, as there are anatomical risks associated with needling
        specific sites.
      </p>
      <p>Sterile needles are used and are safely disposed of after use. The practice and practitioner are registered
        with the City Council to carry out acupuncture; I am fully insured and a member of the British Medical
        Acupuncture Society. </p>
      <strong>
        <p>Does it hurt?</p>
      </strong>
      <p>
        Acupuncture should not be painful as the needles are much finer than the needles used for injections and blood
        tests. There is usually a pin prick sensation on piercing the skin, and subsequent sensations are mild for most
        people during a normal manual acupuncture session. Most of the times, once the needle is in, it’s hardly
        noticeable.
      </p>
      <strong>
        <p>
          Are there any side effects?
        </p>
      </strong>
      <p>Here is a list of some of the side effects you may, or may not, experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Momentary discomfort where the needles are inserted</li>
        <li>Drowsiness and sleepiness</li>
        <li>Bruising</li>
        <li>Temporary worsening of your symptoms</li>
        <li>Fainting</li>
        <li>Onset of a migraine headache, if you are a sufferer</li>
        <li>Feeling faint, during or after treatment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is a list of some of the rare, but serious, problems that may be a risk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Damage to an internal organ from insertion of a needle</li>
        <li>Infection in the area where the needle was inserted</li>
        <li>Infection from Hepatitis or HIV if dirty needles are used</li>
        <li>Infection spreading through the blood system to infect previously damaged heart valves.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please remember that, luckily, the above problems are very rare.</p>
      <p>Acupuncture should be used with due caution in pregnant women, although there are no established risks that are
        specific to pregnancy.” (The British Medical Acupuncture Society)</p>
      <strong>
        <p>Should I see my doctor first?</p>
      </strong>
      <p>If you have any worries that you have an illness, or want to run something by your doctor first, you should
        always check in to put your mind at ease.</p>
      <p>However, most back and joint pain can be treated straight away by an osteopath, without the need for a
        referral.</p>
      <p>Some insurers do need you to see your doctor first, so when you have a new injury, I always recommend calling
        your insurer first and seeing if you can come straight to me or if you need a referral.</p>
      <strong>
        <p>What should I wear?</p>
      </strong>
      <p>Wear loose fitting clothing so that you’re an area of your body is easily accessible.</p>
      <p>For certain problems we may need you to remove an item of clothing so we can see how your body moves and
        provide more effective treatment, but if you are uncomfortable with this please let me know.</p>
      <strong>
        <p>Is it used at the same time as my osteopathic treatment or in a separate appointment?</p>
      </strong>
      <p>Medical Acupuncture can be done as a sole treatment or can be used at the same time as your osteopathic
        treatment if I thinks it will be beneficial for you and your consent is necessary before the use of needles on
        you.</p>
      <p>I will normally use four or more sterile ultra-fine needles, and may leave them in the body for approximately 5
        – 20 minutes. Once the needles are removed, I may then use other osteopathic techniques to encourage the desired
        tissue change. </p>
